## Getting Started
Welcome to my epic SQL Project!!!!

### Prerequisites

I imagine you will need to have "MySqlWorkbench" downloaded and a grasp of it . Also, having the sample data, as well as having an account on (dbdiagram) https://dbdiagram.io/home to acess the ER model

## Usage

The main idea of my project is to create a database that will keep data of prayers that users like, create, or even save that they made or other users created. The point of my database is to be a more effective way to let users save and like prayers.

## Database Structure

The structure of my database revolves around my ER Diagram. I have supplied the script along with detailed notes on the keys and cardinalities of the data.

## Sample Data
The sample data has been included in the "Table Data" folder, which has 14 rows of sample data for each of the tables.
